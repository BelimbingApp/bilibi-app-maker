# Bilibi app maker

The Bilibi app maker is the starting copy for your own application built on Bilibi. For example, you can combine the Bilibi Platform, Finance and your own private Extension in one application. The application records the exact versions of these parts, so you can release it to your servers and take Bilibi updates later.

**Status:** version 0.1, in active development.

## When to use it

Use Bilibi app maker to run your own Bilibi on your servers. For developing and contributing to Bilibi, use the [Platform repository](https://github.com/BelimbingApp/bilibi). 

> [!NOTE]
> In your application, replace this introduction and **Start here** with your own introduction. The linked guides describe your application as they are.

## Start here

1. Clone the maker into a folder named after your product, and start it:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/BelimbingApp/bilibi-app-maker my-bilibi
cd my-bilibi
./bilibi start
```

Your copy opens at `https://bilibi.localhost`. If you run more than one Bilibi on this computer, give each its own name with `BILIBI_DEV_HOST=<name>.localhost` in `.env` beside `./bilibi`; see [Settings](docs/guides/settings.md).

Leave `./bilibi start` running; it rebuilds and reloads when the code changes. Run `./bilibi update` any time, including in another terminal while start is running, to bring sources to their saved commits.

The first start installs what is missing, such as Rust, PostgreSQL and Node, and builds Bilibi, so it takes a while. On the first start, Bilibi opens in your browser at the sign-in page. Later starts print its address. Sign in as `ai@agent.my` / `bilibi-dev`. You now have the Platform on its own: sign-in, companies, people, users, permissions and audit.

2. Add the business features you want. A Domain is one business area, such as Finance:

```sh
./bilibi add finance
./bilibi start
```

The **Software** page in Bilibi lists what is available, and shows the exact `add` command for each one.

3. Make it yours. Create an empty private repository on GitHub, for example `your-company/my-bilibi`, then run:

```sh
git remote rename origin upstream
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-company/my-bilibi.git
gh repo set-default your-company/my-bilibi
git push -u origin main
```

Your folder now has two remotes. `origin` is your application, where you push. `upstream` is the maker, so you can take its later improvements: see [Take maker updates](docs/guides/maker-updates.md#take-maker-updates).

> [!WARNING]
> Clone the maker as shown. A copy made any other way, such as a downloaded ZIP file, has none of the maker's history, and maker updates can then no longer merge.

4. Build and release the versions you tested. Commit and push changes in each part's own repository first. These commands need Docker:

```sh
./bilibi build
./bilibi release --tag setup-v1.0.0
```

Build asks about each part with new commits. Say yes to use them and save the build record only after the build succeeds, or no to build its saved version. Release requires a successful build of the current record, then commits it and starts the GitHub release build. GitHub uses exactly those saved versions.
To install it on a server, follow [Release your setup](docs/guides/releasing.md#release-your-setup) and [Install a release](docs/guides/installing.md#install-a-release).
